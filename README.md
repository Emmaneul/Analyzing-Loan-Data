# Matplotlib and Seaborn Data Analysis Project

In this project, we undergo a data visualization process to understand the key differences between two sets of loan customers; namely, those who pay back their loan and those who fail.
We then use these visualizations to pick the best Machine Learning algorithm to predict future customers.
